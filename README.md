# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-
Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning is a project that applies machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The system uses various features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other medical parameters to analyze patterns and assess risk.
